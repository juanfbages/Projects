## Description

This repo hosts personal data projects, as well as those where I have worked with collaborators. Each project includes a folder for data, scripts, and iPython notebooks. In the future, I will include links to my personal website (currently under construction) of results and summaries for each project. 

## Current Projects

* [NBA: Grouping teams by play style](#nba)

## Reproducibility

For each project I will provide the data (or colleciton method), scripts, and iPython notebooks. All results can be replicated with the files provided.  

## Dependencies
* I try to use standard python modules that can be installed using ```pip```
* While not required, I recommend installing and maintaining packages using [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda)

## Projects

### NBA

In this project we try to group NBA teams by playing style. We take a close look at the metrics that define team's playing styles and apply dimensionality reduction, clustering, and trees to find our answer. This project is still in progress. 

## Collaborators

Some of these projects I have worked on my own, and others I have paired up with awesome data enthusiasts. For more details check the individual project README files.

I and my collaborators are open to sharing our findings. If you find any of our work interesting and want to share/use it, just make sure to give us a shout-out. Individual collaborators are listed in the READMEs of each project.
